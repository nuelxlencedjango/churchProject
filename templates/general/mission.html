        <p>OUR MESSAGE  IS  ALL ABOUT JESUS CHRIST,  HIS  KINGDOM COMMISSION , HIS PASSION (the souls he died for ) AND HIS
            GLORY</p>
        <!--<p>We think it’s possible for Christians to be the most generous people there are. We’ve been blessed as a church to always reach beyond ourselves and serve our city and this world because we have generous people. We’ve seen God do extraordinary things in people’s finances when they put God first in their tithes. We dare you to be a generous, selfless contributor and watch God do the extraordinary.“One gives freely, yet grows all the richer; another withholds what he should give, and only suffers want. Whoever brings blessing will be enriched, and one who waters will himself be watered.” Proverbs 11:24-25</p>-->

                <h3>Our Vision</h3>
                <div class="text-details">
                    <P>Our vision is to raise an army of supernatural giants who love with passion, demonstrating the character of the Holy Spirit in this end-time move of God. We believe that we are living in a crucial time in history, where God is calling His people to rise up and be vessels of His power and glory</P>
                    <P>Raising an army of supernatural giants means equipping and empowering believers to operate in the supernatural realm through the Holy Spirit. We believe that the same Spirit who raised Jesus from the dead dwells within us (Romans 8:11), and He desires to work through us to bring about miraculous signs, wonders, and demonstrations of His power. Our vision is to see every believer walking in their identity as sons and daughters of God, equipped with spiritual gifts, and manifesting the supernatural in their lives.</P>
                    <P>In this end-time move of God, we envision a church that reflects the character and nature of the Holy Spirit. We desire to see believers filled with love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control (Galatians 5:22-23). Our vision is to see the fruit of the Spirit manifested in our lives and in our interactions with others, creating a culture of love, unity, and genuine relationship.</P>
