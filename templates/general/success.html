        <p>God is THE giver of every good and perfect gift (James 1:17). As His image-bearers, we are called to copy His giving, to be mini-pictures of His infinitely large heart. The larger our hearts (and the wider our hands), the larger the picture we paint of Godâ€™s character. What do people think of God when they think of the way you use your money?  </p>
